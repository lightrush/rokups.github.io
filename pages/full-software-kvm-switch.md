# Full software kvm switch for VMs

I already wrote on [Sharing HID devices with KVM virtual machine](#!pages/kvm-hid.md), but this is way better. It solves same problem but more elegantly and painless than ever. For description of the problem read original article. This article assumes you have to GPUs one of which is dedicated to host and another is dedicated to VM. You use one main monitor that has multiple inputs. Two inputs are connected one to each GPU. Monitor must be i2c-capable!

## Perquisites

* sshd server on Linux host.
* [ddcutil](http://www.ddcutil.com/)
* [mControl](http://www.entechtaiwan.com/files/mc_setup.exe)
* [putty.exe](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe)
* [puttygen.exe](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe)

## Host Setup

1. Core of our setup is shell script attaching and detaching USB devices as well as controlling monitor input. Save script below to `/usr/local/bin/vm-attach.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

monitor=1
input=3
devices=(1234:5678 9ABC:DEFG)
vmname=$(virsh list | sed -n '3p' | sed -nr 's/ *[0-9]+ +(.*) +running/\1/p')

attach_device() {
	vmname=$1
	device=(${2//:/ })
	action=$3
	xml_name=/tmp/device-${device[0]}:${device[1]}.xml

	echo "<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb'>"      > $xml_name
	echo "  <source>"                                >> $xml_name
	echo "          <vendor id='0x${device[0]}'/>"   >> $xml_name
	echo "          <product id='0x${device[1]}'/>"  >> $xml_name
	echo "  </source>"                               >> $xml_name
	echo "</hostdev>"                                >> $xml_name

	virsh $action-device $vmname $xml_name
}

if [ "$1" == "attach" ];
then
	for dev in "${devices[@]}"
	do
		attach_device "$vmname" $dev attach
	done
	ddcutil setvcp 60 $input --bus=$monitor
else
	for dev in "${devices[@]}"
	do
		attach_device "$vmname" $dev detach
	done
fi
```
2. You will need to edit above script and replace `devices` array values with correct `vendor:product` ids from `lsusb`. You can add more than two devices. You can add devices that do not necessarily are connected - script will gracefully fail when they are missing and work when they are connected.
3. Set `monitor` value to i2c device of your monitor you would like to switch. Set `input` value to correct input on your monitor. Setting these can be bit of trial and error. You can see your monitor's input codes via `sudo ddcutil capabilities --bus=[your monitor's i2c device number] | grep 60 -A10`. The input codes are in hex and some ports may look like `0x0f`.
4. Now make new ssh key with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "vm-attach" -f vm-attach`.
5. Extract public key with `ssh-keygen -y -f vm-attach`
6. Edit `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` to contain:
```
    command="/usr/local/bin/vm-attach.sh detach",no-port-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding ssh-rsa AAAAB3N<.... rest of your extracted key>
```
7. For a good measure do `chmod -R 600 /root/.ssh && chmod 700 /root/.ssh`.
8. Nvidia users may need to create `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia-ddc.conf` that fixes i2c support (required for `ddcutil`):
```
	Section "Device"
			Driver          "nvidia"
			Identifier      "Videocard0"
			Option          "RegistryDwords" "RMUseSwI2c=0x01; RMI2cSpeed=100"
	EndSection
```
9. Run `sudo modprobe i2c-dev` to load required i2c module and create file `/etc/modules-load.d/i2c.conf` with a single line to automate module loading on boot:
```
i2c-dev
```

Host setup is done. Invoking `sudo vm-attach.sh attach` you should get your USB devices and monitor switched to a VM.

## VM setup

Since Windows is most common case that is what i will be detailing in this section. Besides if you got so far and you want same setup for linux setup will be pretty obvious to you anyway.

1. Install `mControl`. For sake of simplicity i copied `mControl.exe` to documents folder where i placed other scripts though it is not necessary.
2. Copy `vm-attach.id_rsa` from host to VM and use `puttygen.exe` to convert it to `vm-attach.ppk`.
3. Create and save new connection using `putty.exe` to connect to `root@host_ip_addr`. Use `vm-attach.ppk` for auth. Save it with name `vm-attach`.
4. Create powershell script `detach.ps1`. You may need to change `1` to reflect correct input used by host.
```ps
C:\Users\User\Documents\mControl setcontrol 60 1	# Switches monitor input to slot 1
C:\Users\User\Documents\putty -load vm-attach		# Executes vm-attach connection saved in putty
```

And that's it. Running this script will first switch monitor input to the host and then execute `/usr/local/bin/vm-attach.sh detach` which should detach usb devices.

## Conclusion

With bit of effort and right hardware we have achieved full software KVM switch. In [previous article](#!pages/kvm-hid.md) i mentioned binding these commands to hotkeys. Binding same hotkey on both host and VM gives perfect experience - as if you were toggling between two computers using KVM switch. Best part - this solution uses off-the-shelf parts (well maybe except for `mControl`) and is way simpler than previous attempt. Enjoy!
